              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Hey, I'm Gautam Mhetre ‚Äî someone who‚Äôs always been curious about how things work and how to make them better. That curiosity turned into a passion for technology, and over the past few years, it‚Äôs grown into something deeper: a drive to build things that solve real problems.

I‚Äôm currently pursuing my degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from SPPU, graduating in 2026. Along the way, I‚Äôve explored data science, machine learning, and web development ‚Äî not just to learn them, but to apply them meaningfully. Whether it‚Äôs predicting air quality in Delhi or building a rule-based chatbot, I like creating things that actually do something.

I don‚Äôt chase hype; I chase understanding. I believe learning never stops, and even a small project can teach something big. Outside of coding, I enjoy experimenting with new tools, helping out fellow learners, and pushing myself to think a little differently each day.

This portfolio is a glimpse into what I‚Äôve built, what I‚Äôm building, and the kind of work I want to keep doing.</p>
